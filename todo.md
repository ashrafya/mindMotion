# Things Jordan Needs to do
* Email Yawar with a 5 day roadmap
* identify features to add to the brace

# Next Goal
* Rotate Both Motors clockwise and anticlockwise


# Things to do
* Train 200 repetitions for the following commands
  * Left
  * Right
  * Up 
  * Down
* Research the Power, Voltage and Current requirements for the following motors
  * DSSERVO - RDS5160
  * DSSERVO - RDS3235
  * HRB Grpahene Battery 
* Research how to connect these components ad what electrical componental requirements exist:
  * H-Bridge?
  * Voltage Regulators?
  * Relays?
  * Motor Drivers?
  * etc
* Communicate using bluetoooth moduel - (ESP8266)
* Come up with design for CB layout


# Features Done
* Able to communiate from Emotiv to Python
* able to communicate from python to arduino



## Things to know
* Emotiv to python comms are done via osc library call back function
* python to Arduino comms are done over COM port (currently COM 4)
